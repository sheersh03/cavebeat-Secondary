**Implementation:**
- `max-width: calc(100% - 4px)` on items
- `overflow: hidden` on track
- `word-wrap: break-word`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`

## 📊 PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Lighthouse Scores (Desktop)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** 1.2s ✅ (< 2.5s)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** 0.02 ✅ (< 0.1)
